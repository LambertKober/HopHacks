# Repository for Time.ly

Time.ly is a simple office-hour scheduling app that allows users to schedule, book, and request office hours via a calendar display (similar to when2meet). The app offers office-hour optimization via a max-flow algorithm and includes a number of features to make office hours easier for both CAs and students.
